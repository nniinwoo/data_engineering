    "# We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.\n",

    "# Adding In The Catalog\n",
    "# 1. Let’s add in our first item, the Lovely Loveseat that is the store’s namesake. Create a variable called lovely_loveseat_description and assign to it the following string:\n",
